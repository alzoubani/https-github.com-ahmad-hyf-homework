Dark chocolate means the shiny, dark-reddish brown treat produced from the cacao bean, theobroma cacao, widely sold as pressed blocks, bars or as a coating for sweet fillings.

Before Joseph Fry developed the first mass-produced chocolate bar in Bristol, in 1847, dark chocolate was more commonly consumed as a thick, gritty drink that needed constant stirring to keep it emulsified. This original drinking chocolate was simply ground up cacao beans, sometimes made into pastilles, to which hot water or milk, sugar and spices were added.

Mr Fryâ€™s technique involved separating the beans from their fat, known as cocoa butter, and the cocoa solids. Dark chocolate bars are made by adding back only a proportion of cocoa butter to a greater or lesser proportion of cocoa solids in a complicated process that requires careful milling and exact changes of temperature to create a smooth texture. Tempering then encourages the mixture to crystallise and set in a way that gives both snap and shine.
